TS is a "superset" to JS.
It is a programming lang. which extends JS. The core language is JS. The JS sytax stays the same but TS adds more features to the  JS syntax.
JS on it's own is dynamically typed. No declarations. This means that variable types are determined and checked at runtime. Type-related errors are discovered at runtime.
TS is statically typed meaning that variable types are determined and checked at complile-time.
TS will reduce errors in our projects.
